# Umbilicus: Ascension
Re-mixed from [Umbilicus](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/umbilicus-%E2%80%93%C2%A0descent-team-delta), 
made for the 2015 Global Game Jam.

## Referenced Open Source Projects
1. [InControl](https://github.com/pbhogan/InControl), an input manager for Unity that
tames the cross-platform controller beast. InControl is not included in this repo.

2. [Umbilicus, n&eacute;e FarscapeFreefall](https://github.com/YoriKv/FarscapeFreefall), 
the code-base we started with.

Note: The original code base depended on [2D Toolkit](http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/), 
which costs $75. We refactored the code to use Unity-native 2D tools, which are free.
