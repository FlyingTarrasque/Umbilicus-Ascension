In _Umbilicus: Ascension_ you are part of a team that must escape a pit. You must cooperate
and coordinate with each other (out of game) to carefully maneuver to the top. However,
only one player can actually win the game. 

The entire team is sharing one oxygen tank that depletes over time. Scattered powerups will
replenish your oxygen tank. In addition, each player has a unique ability they can leverage
to help the entire team advance. However, any player can decide to cut the oxygen cord, 
which detaches everyone but also leaks oxygen at a much faster rate. 

How will you reach the top?
